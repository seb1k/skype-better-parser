# skype-better-parser

I needed a better parser than the original to read my old conversations, I share it here


- Show images in conversation
- Clickable links
- Better interface
- Archive open in 1 click


Use it here :

[index_better.html](https://seb1k.github.io/skype-better-parser/index_better.html)


Or Installation :

Put index_better.html in the same directory as the exported converation and open it.
